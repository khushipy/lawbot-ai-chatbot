The application follows these steps to provide responses to your questions:
1.PDF Loading: The app reads multiple PDF documents and extracts their text content.
2.Text Chunking: The extracted text is divided into smaller chunks that can be processed effectively.
3.Language Model: The application utilizes a language model to generate vector representations (embeddings) of the text chunks.
4.Similarity Matching: When you ask a question, the app compares it with the text chunks and identifies the most semantically similar ones.
5.Response Generation: The selected chunks are passed to the language model, which generates a response based on the relevant content of the PDFs.
